The HCAHPS contains qualitative measures of a patient's experience including cleanliness of the hospital, pain management, effective communication by doctors and nurses. One of it's key metrics is the star rating, which reflects an overall rating for the hospital.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to investigate any relationships the HCAHPS star rating may have with other HCAHPS measures and other metrics of patient experience like mortality rate, cost, and re-admission for complications. In doing so, we hope to gain a better understanding of what kind of experience this star rating is actually capturing, especially given that it can be used to increase or decrease the amount of reimbursement a hospital receives from Medicare. We are looking to answer 3 questions in particular:\r\n\r\n1) Which of HCAHPS's other metrics is most similar to the star rating?\r\n2) Does the star rating capture other metrics out there, besides those in HCAHPS?\r\n3) What should hospitals focus on improving in order to increase their star ratings?\r\n\r\n## The Data\r\n\r\nMost of our data was obtained through either the national Medicare databases or New York state medical databases. Our primary dataset was the [HCAHPS] (https://data.medicare.gov/Hospital-Compare/Patient-survey-HCAHPS-Hospital/dgck-syfz). For our other metrics, we focused on [payment/value] (https://data.medicare.gov/Hospital-Compare/Payment-and-value-of-care-Hospital/c7us-v4mf) and [cost] (https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/Hospital-Inpatient-Cost-Transparency-Beginning-200/7dtz-qxmr) and mortality rates for [heart failure, pneumonia, and Acute Myocardial Infarction ] (https://data.medicare.gov/Hospital-Compare/Readmissions-Complications-and-Deaths-Hospital/7xux-kdpw), and [Percutaneous Coronary Intervention](https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/Cardiac-Surgery-and-Percutaneous-Coronary-Interven/jtip-2ccj). We also examined [complications] (https://data.medicare.gov/Hospital-Compare/Complications-Hospital/632h-zaca ), rates for [hospital acquired infections] (https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/Hospital-Acquired-Infections-Beginning-2008/utrt-zdsi), [readmissions rate] (https://data.medicare.gov/Hospital-Compare/Hospital-Readmissions-Reduction-Program/9n3s-kdb3 ), and [ER wait times] (https://data.medicare.gov/Hospital-Compare/Timely-and-Effective-Care-Hospital/yv7e-xc69).\r\n\r\n## Exploring the HCAHPS Dataset\r\n\r\nFirst, we explored the relationship of star ratings to other HCAHPS metrics, which are:\r\n\r\n* Cleanliness\r\n* Quietness\r\n* Communication with doctor and nurse\r\n* Discharge communication\r\n* Communication about medication\r\n* Care Transition\r\n* Staff Responsiveness\r\n* Pain Management\r\n* Overall Rating\r\n\r\n![heatmap1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anniey/Hospital-Ranking-CS107/gh-pages/images/download.png)\r\n\r\nWe visualized the relationship of star ratings to the other HCAHPS metrics using the heat map above, which shows the distance between any two objects. Looking at the star rating column, we can see that the communication of nurses is the metric closest to star ratings, followed by communications on aftercare medication and staff responsiveness. We used these 10 metrics in a k-nearest neighbor model and was able to correctly predict star ratings with a 90% accuracy. Our next step was to see if we could improve our accuracy further with additional patient experience metrics outside of the HCAHPS.\r\n\r\n## Integrating Other Measures of Patient Experience\r\n\r\nWe examined the following non-HCAHPS metrics:\r\n\r\n* Mortality rates for heart failure, AMI, pneumonia, and PCI\r\n* Cost of treatment\r\n* Readmission rates\r\n* Rate of complications like infection at hospital and development of blood clots\r\n* Wait times at emergency departments\r\n\r\nWhen we examined the relationship of these metrics against star ratings, we saw a wide varied of results that can be bucketed into three broad categories:\r\n\r\n****The intuitive findings:\r\n    ![READ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anniey/Hospital-Ranking-CS107/gh-pages/images/readmission.png)\r\n\r\n****The non-intuitive ones\r\n    ![risk](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anniey/Hospital-Ranking-CS107/gh-pages/images/riskmort.png)\r\n\r\n****the contradictory ones\r\n    ![HF](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anniey/Hospital-Ranking-CS107/gh-pages/images/HF.png)\r\n\r\n## Takeaways",
