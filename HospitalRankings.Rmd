Load data from local file:
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
#cost sets

```

##Wrangling
Limit Data Sets to NYS only:
```{r}
paymentandvalue <- paymentandvalue %>% filter(State=="NY")
paymentandvalue <- paymentandvalue %>% filter(State=="NY")
complicationshospital <- complicationshospital %>% filter(State=="NY")
hcahps <- hcahps %>% filter(State=="NY")
timely <- timely %>% filter(State=="NY")
readmission <- readmission %>% filter(State=="NY")
mortality <- mortality %>% filter(State=="NY")
```

Combine all the datasets that use Provider ID and Facility ID, respectively
```{r}

#first, join the datasets with providerIDs
providerID_data <- complicationshospital %>%
  select(c(Provider.ID, Hospital.Name, Measure.Name, Measure.ID, Compared.to.National, Denominator, Score, Lower.Estimate, Higher.Estimate, Location))

providerID_data <- hcahps %>%
  select(c(Provider.ID, HCAHPS.Measure.ID, HCAHPS.Question, Patient.Survey.Star.Rating, HCAHPS.Answer.Percent, HCAHPS.Linear.Mean.Value)) %>%
  transform(Provider.ID = factor(Provider.ID)) %>%
  right_join(providerID_data, by = "Provider.ID")

providerID_data <- paymentandvalue %>%
  select(c(Provider.ID, Payment.measure.ID, Payment.measure.name, Payment.category, Denominator, Payment, Value.of.care.display.ID, Value.of.care.display.name, Value.of.care.category)) %>%
  right_join(providerID_data, by = "Provider.ID")

#split the coordinates from the location column. we will use it later to help ID hospitals with varying name conventions btw the provider and facility dataset
providerID_data <- providerID_data %>%
  separate(Location, into = c("Location", "Location.1"), sep = "\\(")
  
#next join all the datasets with facility ID (remove 2008 from hospitalinfection)
facilityID_data <- hospitalinfection %>%
  select(-c(Hospital.Name)) %>%
  filter(Year > 2008) %>%
  right_join(inpatientcost, by = c("Facility.Id", "Year"))

colnames(PCIbyhospital)[1] <- "Facility.Id"
colnames(PCIbyhospital)[6] <- "Year"

temp <- PCIbyhospital %>%
  select(-c(Detailed.Region, Region, Hospital.Name)) %>%
  transform(Year = as.numeric(levels(Year))[Year]) %>%
  filter(Year %in% c("2010", "2011", "2012"))

facilityID_data <- facilityID_data %>%
  filter(Year > 2009) %>%
  left_join(temp, by = c("Facility.Id", "Year"))

#clean case convention and column name
facilityID_data$Facility.Name <- toupper(facilityID_data$Facility.Name)

colnames(facilityID_data)[13] <- c("Hospital.Name")
```


Now let's try to join the ProviderID dataset with the FacilityID dataset using the Hospital/Facility Name. First, we need to clean up some of the varying naming conventions between the two datasets. We will use ProviderID as the convention since it has the shorter list

```{r}
#find the hospital names that are slightly different between the datasets

facilityID_data$Hospital.Name <- as.character(facilityID_data$Hospital.Name)
providerID_data$Hospital.Name <- as.character(providerID_data$Hospital.Name)

FacilityNames <- facilityID_data %>%
  select(Hospital.Name, Location.1) %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  unique()

HospitalNames <- providerID_data %>%
  select(Hospital.Name, Location.1) %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  unique()

#merge the tables and find where there is unmerged rows
ProblemNames <- merge(FacilityNames, HospitalNames, by = "Hospital.Name", all = TRUE)

```


Quickly scanning the list of merged names, we notice that a common difference in convention between the datasets is the use of "INC" vs ", INC". Let's update FacilityID from "INC" to ", INC".
```{r}

#Update FacilityID's uses "INC" to match ProviderID's ", INC"
facilityID_data$Hospital.Name <- gsub(" INC", ", INC", facilityID_data$Hospital.Name)

#rerun the merged datasets
FacilityNames <- facilityID_data %>%
  select(Hospital.Name, Location.1) %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  unique()

#merge the tables and find where there is unmerged rows
ProblemNames <- merge(FacilityNames, HospitalNames, by = "Hospital.Name", all = TRUE)
```

It also looks like the facility database has separate IDs for different divisions of a hospital provider. Let's remap all these divisions to the parent provider
```{r}

#rename Catskill to remove from further cleaning
facilityID_data$Hospital.Name <- gsub("CATSKILL REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER - G. HERMANN SITE", "CATSKILL REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER G HERMANN SITE", facilityID_data$Hospital.Name)

#remove division name following -
facilityID_data$Hospital.Name <- gsub(" - [A-z ]*", "", facilityID_data$Hospital.Name)

#refilter uniques
FacilityNames <- facilityID_data %>%
  select(Hospital.Name, Location.1) %>%
  as.data.frame()

FacilityNames <- FacilityNames[!duplicated(FacilityNames[,1]),]

#merge the tables and find where there is unmerged rows
ProblemNames <- full_join(FacilityNames, HospitalNames, by = "Hospital.Name")

```

We still have a couple more manual changes to make

```{r}

#create table remapping facility name to hospital name
facility_orig = c("ADIRONDACK MEDICAL CENTER-SARANAC LAKE SITE", "BROOKHAVEN MEMORIAL HOSPITAL MEDICAL CENTER INC", "BROOKLYN HOSPITAL CENTER AT DOWNTOWN CAMPUS", "CATSKILL REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER - G.

facility_new = c("ADIRONDACK MEDICAL CENTER", "BROOKHAVEN MEMORIAL HOSPITAL MEDICAL CENTER", "BROOKLYN HOSPITAL CENTER", "CATSKILL REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER - G HERMANN SITE", "CHAMPLAIN VALLEY PHYSICIANS HOSPITAL MEDICAL CTR", "CLIFTON FINE HOSPITAL", "FAXTON-ST LUKE'S HEALTHCARE", "FAXTON-ST LUKE'S HEALTHCARE", "JOHN T MATHER MEMORIAL HOSPITAL OF PORT JEFFERSON", "MARGARETVILLE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL", "MONTEFIORE MEDICAL CENTER", "MONTEFIORE MEDICAL CENTER", "MONTEFIORE MEDICAL CENTER", "MONTEFIORE MOUNT VERNON HOSPITAL", "MOUNT ST MARY'S HOSPITAL AND HEALTH CENTER", "NEW YORK COMMUNITY HOSPITAL OF BROOKLYN, INC.", "NEW YORK-PRESBYTERIAN HOSPITAL", "RIVER HOSPITAL, INC", "ROME MEMORIAL HOSPITAL, INC", "SCHUYLER HOSPITAL, INC", "SOLDIERS AND SAILORS MEMORIAL HOSPITAL OF YATES", "ST JOHN'S EPISCOPAL HOSPITAL AT SOUTH SHORE", "ST JOSEPH'S HOSPITAL, INC", "ST JOSEPH'S HOSPITAL HEALTH CENTER", "ST JOSEPH'S MEDICAL CENTER", "ST LUKE'S CORNWALL HOSPITAL", "ST LUKE'S ROOSEVELT HOSPITAL","ST LUKE'S ROOSEVELT HOSPITAL CENTER", "ST PETER'S HOSPITAL", "ST JOSEPH HOSPITAL", "STATEN ISLAND UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL", "STATEN ISLAND UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL", "UNITED HEALTH SERVICES HOSPITALS, INC", "UNITED MEMORIAL MEDICAL CENTER", "UNITED MEMORIAL MEDICAL CENTER", "UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL (STONY BROOK)", "UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL OF BROOKLYN (DOWNSTATE)", "UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL S U N Y HEALTH SCIENCE CENTER", "WOMAN'S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION HOSPITAL", "WOODHULL MEDICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH CENTER")

#renaming table
remapped_names <- data.frame("Facility Name" = facility_orig, "Provider Name" = facility_new, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

#rename the hospitals in the facilityID_data
facilityID_data$Hospital.Name <- sapply(facilityID_data$Hospital.Name, function(x){
  ifelse(x %in% remapped_names$Facility.Name, remapped_names[facility_orig == x, 2], x)
})

I expected cost to improve with the number of cases seen, does it?
```{r}
PN <- providerID_data %>%
  filter(Payment.measure.ID=="PAYM_30_PN") %>%
  select(Provider.ID, Denominator.x, Payment, Payment.measure.ID) %>%
  na.omit(PN) %>%
  filter(Denominator.x != "Not Available")
PN <- PN[!duplicated(PN), ]
ggplot(PN, aes(Denominator.x, Payment)) + geom_point()

AMI <- providerID_data %>%
  filter(Payment.measure.ID=="PAYM_30_AMI") %>%
  select(Provider.ID, Denominator.x, Payment, Payment.measure.ID) %>%
  na.omit(AMI) %>%
  filter(Denominator.x != "Not Available")
AMI <- AMI[!duplicated(AMI), ]
ggplot(AMI, aes(Denominator.x, Payment)) + geom_point()

HF <- providerID_data %>%
  filter(Payment.measure.ID=="PAYM_30_HF") %>%
  select(Provider.ID, Denominator.x, Payment, Payment.measure.ID) %>%
  na.omit(HF) %>%
  filter(Denominator.x != "Not Available")
HF <- HF[!duplicated(HF), ]
ggplot(HF, aes(Denominator.x, Payment)) + geom_point()
```
No, it does not.

```{r}
library(scales)
PCI <- inpatientcost %>% 
  filter(Year==2010) %>%
  filter(APR.DRG.Description=="Heart Failure")%>%
  filter(APR.Severity.of.Illness.Code==1)
ggplot(PCI, aes(Discharges, Mean.Charge)) + geom_point(color=PCI$APR.Severity.of.Illness.Code) + geom_smooth(method=lm) + scale_x_continuous(trans=log2_trans())

PCI <- inpatientcost %>% 
  filter(Year==2010) %>%
  filter(APR.DRG.Description=="Heart Failure")%>%
  filter(APR.Severity.of.Illness.Code==2)
ggplot(PCI, aes(Discharges, Mean.Charge)) + geom_point(color=PCI$APR.Severity.of.Illness.Code) + geom_smooth(method=lm) + scale_x_continuous(trans=log2_trans())

PCI <- inpatientcost %>% 
  filter(Year==2010) %>%
  filter(APR.DRG.Description=="Heart Failure")%>%
  filter(APR.Severity.of.Illness.Code==3)
ggplot(PCI, aes(Discharges, Mean.Charge)) + geom_point(color=PCI$APR.Severity.of.Illness.Code) + geom_smooth(method=lm) + scale_x_continuous(trans=log2_trans())
```
Severity does not change costs, neither does number of cases. 


```{r}
#temp <- as.data.frame(unique(providerID_data$Provider.ID))
#temp2 <- facilityID_data[!duplicated(facilityID_data$Hospital.Name),]
```

```{r}
readmissionInfection <- filter(readmission, Measure.Name=="READM-30-COPD-HRRP") %>% 
  select(Hospital.Name, Provider.Number, Number.of.Readmissions, Number.of.Discharges)

#convert to correct type
readmissionInfection[, 3] <- as.numeric(as.character( readmissionInfection[, 3] ))
readmissionInfection[, 4] <- as.numeric(as.character( readmissionInfection[, 4] ))
 #omit NAs
na.omit(readmissionInfection)

readmissionInfection <- mutate(readmissionInfection, readmissionRate= `Number.of.Readmissions`/`Number.of.Discharges`)

#time in ED
temp <- timely %>%
  filter(Measure.ID=="ED_1b") #Median time from emergency department arrival to emergency department departure for admitted emergency department patients

temp <- left_join(temp, readmissionInfection, by= "Hospital.Name") %>%
  select(Hospital.Name, Measure.ID, Score, Sample, readmissionRate)
ggplot(temp, aes(x=temp$readmissionRate, y= temp$Score)) + geom_point() + xlab("Readmission Rate") + ylab("ED Wait Times (for admitted patients)")

```

Readmission VS HCAHPS
```{r}
readmitHCAHPS <- left_join(hcahpsSummary, readmissionInfection, by="Hospital.Name")
#filter by overall score
readmitHCAHPS %>%
  filter(HCAHPS.Question=="Summary star rating")%>%
  ggplot(aes(Patient.Survey.Star.Rating, readmissionRate)) + geom_boxplot()
```


```{r}
#THIS IS DRIVING ME CRAZY
#Box plot Scores
complicationshospital <- as.data.frame(complicationshospital)
temp <- select(complicationshospital, Hospital.Name, Score, Measure.Name)
temp$Score <- gsub("Not Available", NA, temp$Score)
```

Look at some serious complications rankings:
```{r}
HFcompScore <- temp %>% filter(Measure.Name=="Heart failure (HF) 30-Day Readmission Rate", rm.na=TRUE) %>% na.omit()
HFcompScore <- as.data.frame(HFcompScore)

HFcompScore <- HFcompScore[order(HFcompScore$Score),]

BloodClotScore <- temp %>% filter(Measure.Name=="Serious blood clots after surgery", rm.na=TRUE) %>% na.omit()
BloodClotScore$Score <- as.numeric(BloodClotScore$Score)
BloodClotScore <- BloodClotScore[order(BloodClotScore$Score),]
```

Let's look at some patient satisfaction scores:
```{r}
hcahpsSummary <- hcahps %>%
  select(Hospital.Name, HCAHPS.Question, Patient.Survey.Star.Rating) %>%
  filter(Patient.Survey.Star.Rating != "Not Applicable")

hcahpsRating <- hcahpsSummary %>%
  filter(HCAHPS.Question=="Summary star rating")
hcahpsRating <- hcahpsRating[order(hcahpsRating$Patient.Survey.Star.Rating),]

temp2 <- hcahps %>%
  select(Hospital.Name, HCAHPS.Question, Patient.Survey.Star.Rating) %>%
  filter(Patient.Survey.Star.Rating != "Not Applicable") %>%
  filter(HCAHPS.Question=="Recommend hospital - star rating")

hcahpsRating <- left_join(hcahpsRating, temp2, by="Hospital.Name")
```

```{r}
HFcompScore
