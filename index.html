<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anniey/Hospital-Ranking-CS107/master/USMap.png" alt=""></p>

<p>As part of the Affordable Care Act, the US government created a national, standardized, publicly reported survey of the patient's experience by hospital (i.e. the HCAHPS). The HCAHPS contains qualitative measures of a patient's experience including cleanliness of the hospital, pain management, effective communication by doctors and nurses. One of it's key metrics is the star rating, which reflects an overall rating for the hospital.</p>

<p>The goal of this project is to investigate any relationships the HCAHPS star rating may have with other HCAHPS measures and other metrics of patient experience like mortality rate, cost, and re-admission for complications. In doing so, we hope to gain a better understanding of what kind of experience this star rating is actually capturing, especially given that it can be used to increase or decrease the amount of reimbursement a hospital receives from Medicare. We are looking to answer 3 questions in particular:</p>

<p>1) Which of HCAHPS's other metrics is most similar to the star rating?
2) Does the star rating capture other metrics out there, besides those in HCAHPS?
3) What should hospitals focus on improving in order to increase their star ratings?</p>

<a id="the-data" class="anchor" href="#the-data" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Data</h2>

<p>Most of our data was obtained through either the national Medicare databases or New York state medical databases. Our primary dataset was the <a href="https://data.medicare.gov/Hospital-Compare/Patient-survey-HCAHPS-Hospital/dgck-syfz">HCAHPS</a>. For our other metrics, we focused on <a href="https://data.medicare.gov/Hospital-Compare/Payment-and-value-of-care-Hospital/c7us-v4mf">payment/value</a> and <a href="https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/Hospital-Inpatient-Cost-Transparency-Beginning-200/7dtz-qxmr">cost</a> and mortality rates for <a href="https://data.medicare.gov/Hospital-Compare/Readmissions-Complications-and-Deaths-Hospital/7xux-kdpw">heart failure, pneumonia, and Acute Myocardial Infarction </a>, and <a href="https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/Cardiac-Surgery-and-Percutaneous-Coronary-Interven/jtip-2ccj">Percutaneous Coronary Intervention</a>. We also examined <a href="https://data.medicare.gov/Hospital-Compare/Complications-Hospital/632h-zaca">complications</a>, rates for <a href="https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/Hospital-Acquired-Infections-Beginning-2008/utrt-zdsi">hospital acquired infections</a>, <a href="https://data.medicare.gov/Hospital-Compare/Hospital-Readmissions-Reduction-Program/9n3s-kdb3">readmissions rate</a>, and <a href="https://data.medicare.gov/Hospital-Compare/Timely-and-Effective-Care-Hospital/yv7e-xc69">ER wait times</a>.</p>

<p>First, we explored the relationship of star ratings to other HCAHPS metrics, which are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cleanliness</li>
<li>Quietness</li>
<li>Communication with doctor and nurse</li>
<li>Discharge communication</li>
<li>Communication about medication</li>
<li>Care Transition</li>
<li>Staff Responsiveness</li>
<li>Pain Management</li>
<li>Overall Rating</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anniey/Hospital-Ranking-CS107/gh-pages/images/download.png" alt="heatmap1"></p>

<p>We visualized the relationship of star ratings to the other HCAHPS metrics using the heat map above, which shows the distance between any two objects. Looking at the star rating column, we can see that the communication of nurses is the metric closest to star ratings, followed by communications on aftercare medication and staff responsiveness. We used these 10 metrics in a k-nearest neighbor model and was able to correctly predict star ratings with a 90% accuracy. Our next step was to see if we could improve our accuracy further with additional patient experience metrics outside of the HCAHPS.</p>

<p>We examined the following non-HCAHPS metrics:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mortality rates for heart failure, AMI, pneumonia, and PCI</li>
<li>Cost of treatment</li>
<li>Readmission rates</li>
<li>Rate of complications like infection at hospital and development of blood clots</li>
<li>Wait times at emergency departments</li>
</ul>

<p>Interestingly, neither cost, mortality, nor complications had particularly strong relationships with star rating. We did find though that payment for pneumonia was lower at hospitals with high star ratings:
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anniey/Hospital-Ranking-CS107/gh-pages/images/pneumonia.png" alt="PN"></p>

<p>We also found that, counter to intuition, rate of heart failure was higher at hospitals with higher ratings:</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anniey/Hospital-Ranking-CS107/gh-pages/images/HF.png" alt="HF"></p>

<p>This could be because treating heart failure requires extensive equipment and training, which tends to be associated with better quality hospitals.</p>

<p>Our remaining findings were more in-line with expectations. Hospitals that had higher star ratings has also shorter wait times for the emergency department and lower readmission rates:</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anniey/Hospital-Ranking-CS107/gh-pages/images/readmission.png" alt="READ">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anniey/Hospital-Ranking-CS107/gh-pages/images/download%20(6).png" alt="ED"></p>

<p>We took a closer look at readmission rates and found that it also appears to be correlated with discharge communication and communication on aftercare medication. Hospitals that had lower readmission rate tended to have better scores on both of those HCAHPS measures:</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anniey/Hospital-Ranking-CS107/gh-pages/images/download.png" alt="medication"> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anniey/Hospital-Ranking-CS107/gh-pages/images/download%20(5).png" alt="discharge"></p>

<p>This indicates that readmission rates reflect to a certain extent the communication skills of hospital staff members. Patients who receive better communications on post-treatment followups are much less likely to run into problems and be readmitted later on. Similarly, although we did not investigate this relationship, one could also presume that hospitals with shorter wait times in the ED probably have more responsive staff (another HCAHPS measure highly correlated with star ratings).</p>

<h2>
<a id="final-prediction-model" class="anchor" href="#final-prediction-model" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Final Prediction Model</h2>

<p>We integrated the four relationships we found prior (heart failure rates, pneumonia treatment cost, readmission rates, and ED wait times) in our HCAHPS knn model. The addition increased our accuracy percentage to around 96%, but as we can see by the clear color boundary in the heat map below, the four factors had much weaker relationship to star ratings than the HCAHPS scores. Indeed, using just those four factors to predict star ratings would have probably had an accuracy rating of around 10-20%.</p>

<h2>
<a id="takeaways" class="anchor" href="#takeaways" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Takeaways</h2>

<p>Returning to our original questions, we found that communications with nurses and communication at discharge was closest in relation to star ratings. Outside of HCAHPS, readmission rates, wait time in ED, heart failure mortality rates, and cost of pneumonia treatment all have a relationship to the star rating. However, these relationships are fairly weak, which suggests both that hospitals should focus on communication training for staff to boost star ratings and that star ratings may not reflect the actual quality of the treatment/care received. </p>

<p>That being said, our dataset was fairly limited in scope; it could be that the samples from the various databases we used do not represent the same populations. Future studies should try to directly compare qualitative ratings against quantitative outcomes for the same sample of patients. Other possible investigations include researching whether the effect of communication on star rating increases with the severity of the treatment, regional differences in the US, and the effect of time (ie does taking the HCAHPS survey 6 months post-treatment cause individuals to focus less on qualitative measures as memories of the experience fades).</p>
