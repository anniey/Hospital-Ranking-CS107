The HCAHPS contains qualitative measures of a patient's experience including cleanliness of the hospital, pain management, effective communication by doctors and nurses. One of it's key metrics is the star rating, which reflects an overall rating for the hospital.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to investigate any relationships the HCAHPS star rating may have with other HCAHPS measures and other metrics of patient experience like mortality rate, cost, and re-admission for complications. In doing so, we hope to gain a better understanding of what kind of experience this star rating is actually capturing, especially given that it can be used to increase or decrease the amount of reimbursement a hospital receives from Medicare. We are looking to answer 3 questions in particular:\r\n\r\n1) Which of HCAHPS's other metrics is most similar to the star rating?\r\n2) Does the star rating capture other metrics out there, besides those in HCAHPS?\r\n3) Can we build a model that predicts star ratings?\r\n\r\n## The Data\r\n\r\nMost of our data was obtained through either the national Medicare databases or New York state medical databases. Our primary dataset was the [HCAHPS] (https://data.medicare.gov/Hospital-Compare/Patient-survey-HCAHPS-Hospital/dgck-syfz). For our other metrics, we focused on [payment/value] (https://data.medicare.gov/Hospital-Compare/Payment-and-value-of-care-Hospital/c7us-v4mf) and [cost] (https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/Hospital-Inpatient-Cost-Transparency-Beginning-200/7dtz-qxmr) and mortality rates for [heart failure, pneumonia, and Acute Myocardial Infarction ] (https://data.medicare.gov/Hospital-Compare/Readmissions-Complications-and-Deaths-Hospital/7xux-kdpw), [PCI mortality] and [Percutaneous Coronary Intervention](https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/Cardiac-Surgery-and-Percutaneous-Coronary-Interven/jtip-2ccj). We also examined [complications] (https://data.medicare.gov/Hospital-Compare/Complications-Hospital/632h-zaca ), rates for [hospital acquired infections] (https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/Hospital-Acquired-Infections-Beginning-2008/utrt-zdsi), [readmissions rate] (https://data.medicare.gov/Hospital-Compare/Hospital-Readmissions-Reduction-Program/9n3s-kdb3 ), and [ER wait times] (https://data.medicare.gov/Hospital-Compare/Timely-and-Effective-Care-Hospital/yv7e-xc69)\r\n\r\n## Exploring the HCAHPS Dataset\r\n\r\n![heatmap1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anniey/Hospital-Ranking-CS107/gh-pages/images/download.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Integrating Other Measures of Patient Experience\r\n\r\nWe examined a variety of metrics.
